Fix callback code not regenerating on save. When a project with callbacks is saved via `project_manager.save_project()`, the custom callback Python files should be regenerated from the current callback configuration. Currently, if a callback's code is updated in the project config, the old .py file may persist. Ensure `_save_custom_callbacks()` is called during `save_project()` and that it overwrites existing callback files with the current code.
